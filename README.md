## Notes for the Presenter

*   The lesson should alternate between short lectures and live demos. You as the teacher need a working local WordPress installation for the demos, as well as an internet connection to install new plugins.
*   With the exceptions of the exercises, students should not be working on their site during lectures and demos. Questions from students will be very specific to their case, so it’s better to plan a period where they can test things on their site and you answer their questions individually.
*   A WordPress.org account and internet access will be necessary to provide feedback on plugins, as well as get help in the plugin's support forums on WordPress.org.

## Example Lesson


### Introduction

In this hour-long session, we will walk through the two basic plugins that come with WordPress, Akismet and Hello Dolly. We'll also cover how to find and install a new plugin through the dashboard, how to evaluate a new plugin for use on your site, how to provide feedback, and how to get help with a plugin through the WordPress.org support forums.

### What are plugins and what can they do?

![plugin-directory](/images/plugin-directory.png)

[Plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/plugins/) provide a way to extend and add to the functionality that already exists in WordPress.. The core of WordPress is designed to be lean and lightweight, to maximize flexibility and to minimize code bloat. Plugins offer custom functions and features so that each user can tailor their site to their specific needs.

> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png) What is the difference between a theme and a plugin? It is common to find cross-over between features found in themes and plugins. However, best practices are:
> *   a theme controls the presentation of content; whereas
> *   a plugin is used to control the behavior and features of your WordPress site.  
>  
> Any theme you create should not add critical functionality. Doing so means that when a user changes their theme, they lose access to that functionality. For example, say you build a theme with a portfolio feature. Users who build their portfolio with your feature will lose it when they change themes. By moving critical features to plugins, you make it possible for the design of your website to change, while the functionality remains the same.

### Examples of Types of Plugins

![browsing-plugins](/images/browsing-plugins.png)

Plugins provide a wide variety of functionality to your WordPress site that does not exist in the WordPress core application. Some examples of different types of plugins include:

*   SEO
*   Backup
*   Security
*   Sliders and Galleries
*   Bulletin Board Forum/Social Network
*   API Plugins (Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc.)
*   Tutorials

### Default Plugins: Akismet and Hello Dolly

![default-plugins](/images/default-plugins.png)

There are two plugins that come with WordPress by default: [Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/), an anti-spam plugin, and [Hello Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/), an example of a really simple plugin.

Akismet checks your comments against the Akismet Web service to see if they look like spam or not and allows you to review the spam it catches under your blog's "Comments" admin screen.

When Hello Dolly is activated, you will randomly see a lyric from "Hello, Dolly", as famously sung by Louis Armstrong, in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

#### Activating Akismet
*   Go to Plugins from the Dashboard menu.
*   Locate **Akismet**, and click on the **Activate** button below the name.
*   Follow the prompts to activate your Akismet account.
*   Once activated with your Akismet key, your blog will be protected from spam comments.

#### Activating Hello Dolly
*   Go to Plugins from the Dashboard menu.
*   Locate **Hello Dolly**, and click on the **Activate** button below the name.
*   Once activated, you will see a lyric from the song at the top right hand corner of the screen.

### Evaluating New Plugins

![evaulating-plugins](/images/evaulating-plugins.png)

The [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) is the best and safest place to get free plugins. All plugins have been reviewed and approved per the plugin guidelines as outlined in [Writing a Plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).

When evaluating new plugins for use on your site, it is important that you locate and review the below standard information provided for each plugin in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Plugins may also be purchased through other sources, make sure to thoroughly research outside plugins yourself as they may not follow the same safe guidelines that the WordPress Repository uses to screen the plugins that they make available.

*   Star Rating
*   Last Updated
*   Number of Downloads
*   Compatibility Rating
*   Author Information & other plugins
*   Support Forums

### Automatically Installing a Plugin from the Plugin Directory

![install-plugin](/images/install-plugin.png)

The [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) is the best and safest place to get free plugins. Before installing a new plugin, it is a best practice to make a full backup of your website, as some plugins could cause your site to become inoperable. See [WordPress Backups]( https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-backups/).

*   Go to **Plugins > Add New** on the Dashboard menu.
*   Search for the plugin name or type, or browse one of the categories or tags.
*   Review the standard information: last updated, number of downloads, compatibility, etc.
*   If you decide to install the plugin, click the **Install** button.
*   After installing a plugin, it must be activated, click the **Activate** button.

### Installing a Plugin via External Zip File

![upload-plugin](/images/upload-plugin.png)

When you purchase plugins from vendors outside of WordPress, the author should provide you with a .zip file that can be installed through the Dashboard. Before installing a new plugin, it is a best practice to make a full backup of your website, as some plugins could cause your site to become inoperable. See [WordPress Backups](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups).

#### Installing Instagram Feed Plugin via External Zip File

*   Download [Instagram Feed Plugin](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/instagram-feed.zip) as a .zip file and save to your desktop
*   Go to **Plugins > Add New** on the Dashboard menu.
*   Click on the blue **Upload Plugin** button at the top of the page.
*   Click the **Choose File** button and browse to the desktop and select the .zip file.
*   Click the **Install Now** button, then click on the **Activate** button.

### Troubleshooting Plugins

![wordpress-errors](/images/wordpress-errors.png)

There may be instances when you activate a new plugin and it breaks your site, i.e. your site will either start acting ‘strangely’, the plugin doesn’t function the way it’s supposed to, or you get the "white screen of death" and you are not able to access your site from the front end or back end. The reasons for that may be a conflict between the installed plugins or an installed plugin being incompatible with the current WordPress version.

If that happens don't worry, there are a few common troubleshooting techniques that will allow you to determine the cause of the misbehavior and reverse its effects. For more information, see [Common WordPress Errors](https://wordpress.org/support/article/common-wordpress-errors/).

### Providing Feedback, Reviews, and Ratings

![reviews](/images/reviews.png)

The best way to improve and help plugin authors make better plugins is to provide feedback by leaving a review and a star rating.

#### Leaving a Review and a Star Rating
1.  Go to the Plugin Directory located at https://wordpress.org/plugins/.
2.  Sign in on the upper top-right with your WordPress.org credentials.
3.  Search for the plugin name that you would like to leave feedback for or get help with.
4.  If you need help or have a problem with a plugin, click on the green **View support forum** button on the right side of the plugin listing or the **Support** tab to visit the plugin support forum.
5.  To leave a star rating, you must also leave a review. Locate on the right side where it says, **Ratings** and click on **Add my review** button below. A form will be presented with information to leave a review and a star rating on that plugin.

### Getting Help in the WordPress.org Plugin Support Forums

![support](/images/support.png)

Each plugin in the WordPress Plugin Directory has a support forum to ask questions about using or configuring the plugin. Please be courteous and thorough when posting questions, as the plugin author is a volunteer and may have other priorities.

1.  Go to the Plugin Directory located at https://wordpress.org/plugins/.
2.  Sign in on the upper top-right with your WordPress.org credentials.
3.  Search for the plugin name that you would like to get help with.
4.  Click on the **View support forum** green button on the right side of the plugin listing or the **Support** tab to visit the plugin support forum.
5.  Before posting a new topic, be sure to [search](https://wordpress.org/search/) to see if one has been started already.
6.  If not, scroll to the bottom of the page and set a good title, select your WordPress version, then describe your issue in the message area with as many details as possible.
7.  Never put password or login credentials in a public forum.
8.  Be patient, if you have not gotten a response in a few days, try rewording your issue or adding information about what you have done to resolve the issue.
